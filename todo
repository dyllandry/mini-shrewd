        A future issue here is that translation units are pixels. So drawing 32 pixels tiled just requires translating them by 32 units left/right. This means on a higher resolution that everything will be smaller. I'd rather keep sprites on the screen the same size between different resolutions. This will require to scale everything I draw by the screen's resolution or better yet physical size if that information is available.
            Sprites might be able to be scaled by transformation.scale
